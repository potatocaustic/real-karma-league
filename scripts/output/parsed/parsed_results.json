Freaks top 100s include captain @supa (17th), @cryfan (53rd), @etan22 (56th), and @glaciers (61st). Honorable mention to Freaks GM @shabd for getting first on Dawson Day unc still got it. Otters had @kiddo (29th), @max (34th), and @psyklone (58th), but a player placing 916th for the Otters leads to a Freaks victory"

They’ll end up being the 2nd highest team score today. With the rest of their team being consistent in the 100s, Hornets look to be a force in the playoffs. \n-\nGamblers gave themselves a chance, but a -550 performance from one of their most original players killed that hope.\n@gschmoney (1st (and tacos legend, sorry)) turns back the clock and becomes today’s karma champion by almost 600.

The Minors had good days from @/idxstyew (3,601, 57th) and @bohm (3,509, 72nd), but it wasn’t enough as the Amigos continue their push for a tough playoff spot in a Western Conference looking much like the NBA’s."

I don’t even know how this happened as today isn’t a big karma day and horses were favourites in this series. Shoutout to the whole creamers side @saquon @verse @znye @glovee @sports6138 and @cle for putting BTA. I expected a closer, intense game 3 from these teams but the EV team prevails, I will post final score in the comments. Creamers vs gravediggers ECF fairs."

Ggs to the chickens as they play a very tough glazerz team in the next round which could honestly go either way. goodluck to both teams and we will see you guys tomorrow ✌️"

Glazerz look like a great dark horse to win this chip and i could definitely see them pushing for it as they have great players including number one on the month @markjackson . good win overall for the glazerz and excited to see what they can do going forward and if they have what it takes to upset these teams going forward"

Clique is still a good team and the fact they made this game a tough one which other teams couldnt do this season makes me not wanna count clique out yet especially with they players they have after trading there stars who requested out who are lowkey looking mid for there new teams. as for the horses they are just an insanely deep team with great chemistry and i can definitely see this team with good players and good draft picks going far this season and maybe winning that chip. goodnight rkl"

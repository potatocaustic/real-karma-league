This game was decided by the OT winner by oilers, as the entire gravediggers lineup went VGK while the demons went EDM. Demons had some fantastic performers today, amigos legends @otf in 9th and @o3wn in 33rd showing up when it matters most, @virgil in 47th, and @tralogik in 62nd as captain. Gravediggers had @_ln4_ come 26th, @derrickwhitetop5 in 48th and captain @cry in 67th but it wasn’t enough."

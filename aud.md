Please perform a full, thorough, and comprehensive efficiency audit of my codebase. Areas of particular concern include:
1. Large amounts of unnecessary data being loaded for certain pages.
2. Excessive edge requests being made for things like team logos with every page refresh
3. Code redundancies across the codebase

Do not make any changes to the code yet - instead, create a separate markdown file that contains the findings of the audit, recommendations for improvement, and a complete and thorough prompt that can be provided to an LLM to complete the recommended efficiency upgrades.

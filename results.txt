Postseason examples:
👑 RKL FINALS GAME 5 👑
(1) Gravediggers (1-4) - 34,565 ❌
(3) Demons (4-1) - 37,201 ✅🏆
————————————
The demons come back to take game 5 and they officially are RKL champions. This game was decided by the OT winner by oilers, as the entire gravediggers lineup went VGK while the demons went EDM. Demons had some fantastic performers today, amigos legends @otf in 9th and @o3wn in 33rd showing up when it matters most, @virgil in 47th, and @tralogik in 62nd as captain. Gravediggers had @_ln4_ come 26th, @derrickwhitetop5 in 48th and captain @cry in 67th but it wasn’t enough.

(3) Creamers (1-1) - 43,324 
(6) Empire (1-1) - 43,170
————————————
Bit of drama here as creamers sneak past the empire to stay alive in this series. Empire were actually ahead by 150 but had 3 players use WNBA hype which means they lose by 150 instead. Creamers had captain @saquon put the team in his back finishing 77th as the only t100, while empire had captain @thereturnofzlo finish 54th also attempt to carrywith nobody else in the t100. This series continues to a game 3.

3. Demons (2-0): 51,458 ✅✅✅
6. Flames (0-2): 44,605
————————-
Demons go fucking crazy dropping 50k and everyone in the top 100 as flames js cant compete with it all. Demons look poised to make a deep run this year with @tralogik leading them. Flames go into the offseason disappointed with the postseason results

Horses (5-0): 58,798.5

Voyage captain @relaxedp (10,323) simply got no help from his teammates today, and they weren’t able to put up a fight against a solid Horses performance led by @chris (10,462).
